Biological Data Analysis Pipeline

This Python script is designed to automate the processing, cleaning, analysis, and integration of biological datasets. 
Specifically, it handles gene expression data and integrates datasets from the UCSC Genome Browser and NCBI. 
It includes functions for cleaning data, analyzing gene expression levels, and merging external genomic data.

Features:
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and standardizes column names for consistency.
- Data Analysis: Computes the top 10 genes with the highest expression levels from the provided datasets.
- Data Integration: Merges gene expression data with external genomic data from UCSC Genome Browser and NCBI based on a common identifier (gene ID).
- Automation: Provides an automated pipeline that processes multiple gene expression datasets, analyzes them, and integrates external genomic data.
